OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    This plugin finds all the ancestors and descendants of an input node for a directed graph. \
    The user has to identify the input node with the node's Id value (not the label value). \
    The origin node, as well as its ancestors and descendants are reported in a variable called "Lineage" (see data laboratory).\n\n\
    This plugin works best for a-cyclic graphs. \
    When there are cycles in the graph, the descendants get prioritized, which means that nodes that are both ancestor and descendant will be marked as descendants.  \n\n\
    This allows the user to filter for ancestors or descendants, or give them different colors, using the partition coloring system.
